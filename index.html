      <h1>Our Furure Tech Innovatiion For Real Estate</h1>
  <li> Possible solutions are making an app/website where it gives virtual house tours that the Real Estate agents are selling/ marketing to the buyers. There’ll be 3D house tours on the app & website. Including house tours in VR for the app specifically, making it feel like you’re touring the actual house in-person. It’ll be a lot easier and efficient when it’s virtual with 3D house tours where you can move around the mouse on the app & website, while also having a VR (Virtual Reality) exclusive tour on the app only, connecting your VR headset, and getting the full experience of a house tour all at HOME! 
</li>
<li>You can still look through houses and see the tour of the house, but it’s virtual and you can even do it on your couch! Especially during this global pandemic, it’s extremely easy to spread the virus (COVID-19), mostly affecting Real estate agents trying to sell their house(s) to buyers but aren’t getting many customers because of social distancing rules. </li>
  <li>Idea(s) for possible tech invention(s) in the future/ ideas</li>
    <li>An app/website where we can add 3d pictures and VR (Virtual Reality)</li>
    <li>The house we want to sell, we want buyers to have the best experience who are going to see it and we're going to add a search-bar where buyers can search up their preference of location of the houses they want and the type of the house they would like. 
</li>
<li>The website will list the best house that is in the area they want it on.
